Disclaimer & licence 
---------------------
The very same as mentioned on https://www.thc.org/thc-hydra/ especially the `[0x04]` stanza.  
I don't own anything on THC brand or hydra, neither am I affiliated or working on the project.  

Last but not least, antivirus softwares might report some binaries as hacktools or even malwares: this is a known and common issue. If you don't trust this compilation, just don't download it.
